Possesses mildly elevated Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH) levels.\n   - Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS): Patient reported a single post-peak day (+7) within normal limits.

NP Thyroid is a natural desiccated thyroid extract derived from porcine thyroid glands and contains both T3 and T4 hormones. Levothyroxine, on the other hand, is a synthetic form of the T4 hormone.\n\n4. **Prolactin Levels and GI Issues**\n   - Advised patient to repeat prolactin testing with fasting, and abstaining from exercise and sexual activity for 1-2 days prior to the blood draw.\n   - Encouraged follow-up with family medicine for gastrointestinal (GI) concerns.\n\n5. **Anxiety/Depression Management**\n   - Patient\u00ef's anxiety and depression are well managed with sertraline, aripiprazole, and methylphenidate. Patient sees a psychiatrist and therapist regularly.\n\n6. **Prediabetes Assessment and Plan**\n   - Hemoglobin A1C: 5.6. Prediabetes management discussed with a focus on dietary changes, exercise, and myoinositol intake. Follow-up scheduled to recheck HbA1c in 3 months.\n\n7. **Insulin Resistance Assessment and Plan**\n   - Repeat fasting insulin level ordered through LabCorp. Patient advised to continue dietary and lifestyle changes discussed for prediabetes management.\n\nIf you need further assistance with additional sections or have any specific requests, please feel free to ask!"
