#Expanded Notes
1. Dysmenorrhea / PCOS
- Mild PCO on US and androgen excess. Discussed the diagnostic criteria and implications of PCOS. Reviewed risk and prevention of hyperplasia in light of irregular/long cycles.  Pt does report regular cycles. Pt started cyclic progesterone (prescribed by naturopath doctor) for dysmenorrhea, which has improved some. Pt is only taking 100mg. Discussed RBA of increasing dose to 200mg. Pt will increase dose to 200mg. Pt will reach out when she needs more refills, as she doesn't want to f/u with naturopathic doctor anymore.
- Pt does struggle with acne and hirsutism. Discussed starting Clear sold by Bella.
- Pt to continue diet/supplement/lifestyle changes as discussed at last visit.
