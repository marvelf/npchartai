Response:

**Assessment and Plan**

1. **Irregular Cycles and Acne**
   - Pelvic ultrasound found to be within normal limits (WNL).
   - Acne management: Patient struggled with acne. Previously took antibiotics (ABX) and other topicals. Currently using Clear supplement. Possesses mildly elevated Anti-M�llerian Hormone (AMH) levels.
   - Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS): Patient reported a single post-peak day (+7) within normal limits. To obtain full Post Peak Hormone Panel (PPHP) on post-peak days +4, +7, and +10.

2. **Prediabetes and Insulin Resistance**
   - Discussed dietary changes: advised increased protein and vegetable intake, and limiting carbs and processed sugars (e.g., whole 30, paleo, or keto).
   - Emphasized regular exercise, such as walking 30-40 minutes most days of the week.
   - Recommended daily intake of 2gm of myoinositol.
   - Planned to recheck hemoglobin A1c levels in 3 months. Consideration of adding metformin.

3. **Thyroid Management**
   - Discussed Risks, Benefits, and Alternatives (RBA) of levothyroxine versus NP thyroid regarding low T3 levels.
   - NP Thyroid is a natural desiccated thyroid extract derived from porcine thyroid glands and contains both T3 and T4 hormones. Levothyroxine, on the other hand, is a synthetic form of the T4 hormone. 

4. **Prolactin Levels and GI Issues**
   - Advised patient to repeat prolactin testing with fasting, and abstaining from exercise and sexual activity for 1-2 days prior to the blood draw.
   - Encouraged follow-up with family medicine for gastrointestinal (GI) concerns.

5. **Anxiety/Depression Management**
   - Patient�s anxiety and depression are well managed with sertraline, aripiprazole, and methylphenidate.
   - Patient sees a psychiatrist and therapist regularly.
