1.	Create the Executable:
•	Navigate to the directory containing your Python script.
•	Run the following command to create the executable:

#Create a spec file
pyinstaller example.py

pyinstaller --onefile Nameofprogram.py 

•	The --onefile flag tells PyInstaller to package everything into a single executable file.
2.	Locate the Executable:
•	Once the process completes, you'll find the stDandalone executable in the dist directory that PyInstaller creates.
3.	Test the Executable:
•	Run the executable to ensure it works correctly before distributing it.
4.	Distribute the Application:
•	You can now share the executable file with your wife. She can download it to her computer and run it without needing to install Python or any dependencies.
5.	Considerations:
•	If your script relies on additional data files, you might need to specify them with the --add-data option.
•	The first time you run the executable on a new machine, it might take longer to start as it extracts the files.
