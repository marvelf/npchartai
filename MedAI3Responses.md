1. Androgen Abnormality:

The patient's testosterone and DHEA levels were found to be decreased, indicating an abnormal androgen profile. During the consultation, I discussed the potential causes and implications of this abnormality with the patient. In order to address this issue, the patient was prescribed DHEA supplementation at a dosage of 25mg. I also explained to the patient the potential benefits and risks associated with DHEA supplementation.

2. Thyroid Function:

The patient's thyroid function was assessed through laboratory testing, which revealed normal TSH levels and low T3 levels. As part of the treatment plan, the patient was advised to take ashwagandha as well as medcaps T3, and T-150 supplements. I discussed the purpose and benefits of these supplements with the patient.

During the consultation, we also discussed the concept of Reverse T3 Dominance (RBA). I explained to the patient that it occurs when the ratio of reverse T3 (rT3) to free T3 (fT3) is elevated, leading to reduced T3 activity and potential symptoms of hypothyroidism. Further investigation and evaluation are required to assess the patient's RBA status.

3. Homocysteine Methylation:

An additional concern was the patient's suspected ethylation homocysteine abnormality, which requires further investigation. I recommended sending the patient for a laboratory test at Quest Diagnostics to analyze homocysteine levels. Once the results are available, appropriate management strategies can be considered.

4. History of Neuroblastoma:

The patient has a pre-existing medical history of neuroblastoma. This information is crucial for any future treatment planning or medical procedures, as it may impact the patient's current health status and possible treatment options.

5. Kidney Cancer and Testosterone:

During the consultation, the patient expressed concerns about a possible connection between kidney cancer and testosterone. It is important to note that while low testosterone levels may be associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including kidney cancer, it does not necessarily mean that there is a direct causative link. Further investigation is required to determine the patient's specific risk factors and any potential underlying conditions that could contribute to kidney cancer.

In summary, the patient presented with decreased testosterone and DHEA levels, normal TSH with low T3, and a suspected ethylation homocysteine abnormality. The patient was prescribed DHEA supplementation and advised to take ashwagandha, medcaps T3, and T-150 supplements. Further evaluation of RBA and homocysteine levels is recommended. Additionally, the patient's history of neuroblastoma was noted, and the concerns regarding kidney cancer and testosterone were acknowledged for future investigation.
