#Brief Notes
1. irregular menses / dysmenorrhea
US - RT ovarian volume 12cc
Lipids, triglycerdise - not fasting
Discussed role of estrogen and progesterone and impacts on uterine lining. Discussed the importance of balancing hormones to improve PMS, abnormal spotting, menorrhagia, and/or dysmenorrhea. Discussed RBA of starting cyclic micronized progesterone. Discussed how to take progesterone and potential SE.
cyclic progesterone x3 cycles 
2. 5.6  â€” hemoglobin A1C
Prediabetes
- Discussed the importance of diet changes: increasing protein and vegetables and limiting carbs/processed sugars (i.e. whole 30, paleo, or keto).
- Discussed the importance of regular exercise (i.e. walking 30-40 minutes most days of the week).
- Discussed taking 2gm of myoinositol daily.
- Will plan to recheck hgbA1c in 3 months. May consider adding metformin.
insulin
repeat level fasting (labcorp)


#Expanded Notes
1. Irregular menses / dysmenorrhea
- Discussed immature HPO axis prior to 25 yo. Usually don't diagnose with PCOS until after 25 yo.
- US overall WNL. Small follicles in both ovaries. RT ovarian volume 12cc. LT ovarian volume 8cc.
- CD 3 labs overall, WNL. Abnormals listed below. FSH/LH 6.5/7.3. Triglycerides were elevated, but pt wasn't fasting. Insulin was elevated, but pt wasn't fasting. Pt to get repeat levels drawn fasting.
- Discussed role of estrogen and progesterone and impacts throughout the menstrual cycle. Discussed the importance of balancing hormones to improve irregular cycles. Discussed RBA of starting cyclic micronized progesterone. Discussed how to take progesterone and potential SE. Pt agreeable to plan. Rx ordered. Pt to also start myoinositol as discussed in more detail below.
- Pt to continue diet/lifestyle/supplement changes as discussed at last visit.
- Pt to f/u in 3 months for cycle review.

2. Hgba1c: 5.6
- Discussed lab is only 0.1% away from pre-diabetes.
- Discussed the importance of diet changes: increasing protein and vegetables and limiting carbs/processed sugars (i.e. whole 30, paleo, or keto).
- Discussed the importance of regular exercise (i.e. walking 30-40 minutes most days of the week).
- Discussed taking 2gm of myoinositol 1-2x/day (can help protect against prediabetes and can also help with hormone balancing).
- Will plan to recheck hgbA1c and fasting insulin in 3 months.
