#Brief Notes
1. post surgical menopause
2. insomnia
progesterone
3. Elevated ALT
repeat CMP
f/u family medicine (or PCP)
4. B 12
B complex, b12 and B9 (methylated cobalamin and methylated folate)
5. Prediabetes
- Discussed the importance of diet changes: increasing protein and vegetables and limiting carbs/processed sugars (i.e. whole 30, paleo, or keto).
- Discussed the importance of regular exercise (i.e. walking 30-40 minutes most days of the week).
- Discussed taking 2gm of myoinositol daily.
- Will plan to recheck hgbA1c in 3 months. May consider adding metformin.
6. vitamin D
Vitamin d is low. This can contribute to low energy and a depressed mood. I recommend taking 10,000 IUs of vitamin d 3 with K2 daily for 3 months. We can recheck levels in 3 months to ensure pt is absorbing vitamin d well. If levels WNL in 3 months, pt can decrease dose to 5,000 IUs daily for maintenance.
7. eczema breakout
going to urgent care later today
Pt's skin is cracking open

#Expanded Notes
1. Post surgical menopause, low E2 of 5.8, testosterone total 18 free 0.8, FSH 89.3
- Pt hasn't been taking hormone treatment in a while, over a year. Pt has taken troches (estradiol/progesterone). Pt was having a hard time covering costs. Pt tried premarin but started having skin problems. Pt didn't tolerate patches either. Pt swelled and itched really bad. Pt has tried taking PO estradiol, but didn't think it helped much. Pt would like a rx for PO estradiol since that is the only hormone she can afford at this time. Pt has taken up to 4mg daily in the past. Right now, will consider starting estradiol 2mg but wait for repeat CMP results first.
- Once pt is able to afford troches again, will consider re-prescribing estradiol/testosterone troches again.

2. Insomnia
- Discussed RBA of trying progesterone to help with insomnia. Pt would like to try progesterone. Medication ordered.

3. Elevated ALT
- Pt to repeat CMP.
- If still elevated, pt to f/u with family med.

4. B12 suboptimal
- Discussed starting B complex, with b12 and B9 (methylated cobalamin and methylated folate)

5. Prediabetes / abnormal weight gain
- Discussed the importance of diet changes: increasing protein and vegetables and limiting carbs/processed sugars (i.e. whole 30, paleo, or keto).
- Discussed the importance of regular exercise (i.e. walking 30-40 minutes most days of the week).
- Discussed taking 2gm of myoinositol twice a day.
- Pt has taken metformin in the past and d/t abnormal weight gain would like to start it again now. Will defer rx until pt can get repeat CMP to recheck liver enzymes.
- Pt to f/u in one month for med check.

6. Vitamin D deficiency
- Vitamin d is low. This can contribute to low energy and a depressed mood. I recommend taking 10,000 IUs of vitamin d 3 with K2 daily for 3 months. We can recheck levels in 3 months to ensure pt is absorbing vitamin d well. If levels WNL in 3 months, pt can decrease dose to 5,000 IUs daily for maintenance.

7. Eczema breakout
- Pt has eczema all over face/body. Skin is cracking.
- Pt is going to try to go to urgent care later today for further evaluation.
