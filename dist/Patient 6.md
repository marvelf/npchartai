#Expanded Notes
1. PMS (increased acne, exhaustion) / hx of ovarian cysts / abnormal estradiol
- PPHP showed estrogen dominance. P4 looks great! Pt is currently taking 400mg of progesterone in luteal phase.
- Discussed avoiding soy.
- Discussed starting DIM (1-2x/day), calcium d glucarate, and/or chaste berry vitex.
- Discussed environmental exposures to synthetic estrogens and how to avoid.
- Discussed seed-cycling, not evidence based.
- Pt's cycles are shortening. They are now 28 days (prior they had been 30 days). Pt starts progesterone on CD 21. Pt to now start progesterone on CD 18 or pk+3.
- Consider repeating US to ensure she doesn't have any new abnormal cysts.
