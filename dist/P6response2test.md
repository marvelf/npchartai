#Expanded Notes
Certainly! I will help you expand the information from the brief notes into a comprehensive medical chart entry. Let's get started:

**Assessment and Plan**

1. **Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and Estrogen Dominance**
   - Recommended repeating ultrasound to monitor any changes.
   - Encouraged patient to avoid soy-containing products.
   - Discussed using diindolylmethane (DIM), calcium D-glucarate, and chasteberry/vitex for estrogen balance.
   - Advised patient to practice seed cycling for hormonal regulation.
   - Educated patient on potential environmental exposures and strategies to avoid them.
   - Previously, patient's menstrual cycles were 30 days in duration; however, they are now 28 days. Patient initiated progesterone supplementation on cycle day 18.
   - Instructed patient to track cycles with mucus and start progesterone supplementation three days after ovulation or on cycle day 18.

This comprehensive plan addresses the patient's concerns related to PMS and estrogen dominance while providing guidance on appropriate supplements and hormonal regulation techniques.
