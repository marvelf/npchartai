**Assessment and Plan**

1. **Post-Menopausal Bleeding and Thickened Endometrium**
   - Patient experienced two days of bleeding around 11/27/23, despite post-menopausal status since 2016.
   - Thickened endometrium: Raised concerns for endometrial pathology or hyperplasia.
   - Recommended Endometrial Biopsy (EMB) as the next step. Patient preferred EMB during hernia surgery due to concerns about multiple surgeries under general anesthesia and her history of brain tumors.
   - Coordination with hernia surgery team at UC Health to ascertain the feasibility of performing EMB simultaneously with the scheduled hernia surgery.

2. **Diet Counseling and History of Cholecystectomy**
   - Patient sought information regarding the keto diet from Sarah Tomlin.
   - Advised caution with high-fat diets, given the patient's history of cholecystectomy. Sarah Tomlin to provide keto diet resources with specific considerations for patients without a gallbladder.

3. **Ear Examination and Pain**
   - Performed ear examination; findings were within normal limits (WNL) with minimal ear wax present.
   - Directed patient to use Debrox to manage ear wax.
   - If ear pain persists, the patient is recommended to follow up for further evaluation and management.
