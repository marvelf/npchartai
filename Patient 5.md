#Expanded Notes
1. Irregular menses in the setting of breastfeeding / TTC
- Education provided on return of menstruation during breastfeeding. Irregular menses are very normal.
- Pt would like to TTC again soon. Discussed deferring work-up / fertility treatment until pt totally weans. Pt has been treated with levothyroxine (for TSH >2.5), metformin and letrozole.
- Pt desires to at least have thyroid panel checked. Thryoid panel ordered.
- Discussed checking FSH and AMH since pt is 42 yo. Pt would like those labs ordered, too.
- Will contact pt with results.
- Pt to f/u once she has weaned baby John and is ready to actively TTC again. Will start hormone work-up first cycle after pt weans.
