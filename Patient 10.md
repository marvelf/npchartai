Response:
**Assessment and Plan**

1. Low libido / low testosterone / low DHEA
- Pt was concerned that sertraline was affecting libido, but pt was struggling with low libido prior to SSRI. Pt did recently decrease dose to 50mg (from 75 mg) and is tolerating well, but still struggling with libido.
- Discussed starting DHEA 25 mg daily.
- Discussed RBA of starting testosterone HRT. 
Pt would like to hold off on testosterone HRT at this time.
Pt mentioned that she is getting work-up with nephrology. She has an abnormal cyst that might be cancer. Pt to discuss with a nephrologist if she can do testosterone HRT if she does want to start it. Pt also has hx of neuroblastoma.
2. Vaginal dryness/irritation
- Pt was prescribed estradiol cream. Pt still had some questions about estradiol rx. Questions answered.
- Pt had questions about estradiol cream and impacts on charting with NFP (pt tracks cycles with Creighton / Marquette). Discussed that while estradiol cream is mostly absorbed locally, there is a chance it could be absorbed systemically potentially causing alterations in cycle tracking.
- Pt has started Revaree, which has helped some.
- Pt is still going to consider whether or not she will start estradiol cream.
- Will consider adding progesterone if pt desires more long term tx with vaginal estradiol cream.
3. Normal TSH, low t3 and symptoms of hypothyroidism
- Discussed taking ashwagandha, medcaps T3, or T-150.
- Discussed RBA of starting a rx. Pt prefers to hold off on rx at this time.
